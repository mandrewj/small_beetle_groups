## Overview
Welcome to *{{ frontmatter.project }}*, a website of taxon pages generated from the {{ frontmatter.project }} Project, a comprehensive collaborative effort managed in [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org).

The purpose of this project is to comprehensively catalog a number of beetle lineages which have comparativey lower species diversity. Nearly all of the larger families have a community of active workers who curate and publish thorough taxonomic lists. However, many groups are without active workers and lack the visibility of those larger families in the taxonomic community.  This project addresses those gaps by pulling together a team of coleopterists to catalog them and make the names available to Catalog of Life and other online databases.

## Taxonomic Coverage
* AMDRDL - The project started with the focus on the lineages Archostemata, Myxophaga, Dascilloidea, Rhipiceroidea, Derodontoidea, and Lymexyloidae - with a combined estimated diversity of just over 900 species.
* The project was delayed by the global COVID pandemic, but during that pause new groups have been added: 
CLEROIDEA:
Rentoniidae (6 genera, 11 species)
Peltidae (1 genus, 10 species)
Protopeltidae (1 genus, 2 species)
Thymalidae (4 genera, 21 species)
TENEBRIONOIDEA:
Ulodidae (14 genera, 39 species)
Boridae (3 genera, 4 species)
Pythidae (7 genera, 23 species)
Prostomidae (2 genera, 30 species)
Archeocrypticidae (10 genera, 53 species)
Promecheilidae (10 genera, 23 species)
ELATEROIDEA:
Rhagophthalmidae (10 genera, 70 species)
Iberobaeniidae (1 genus, 3 species)
Jurasaidae (2 genera, 6 species)
Brachypsectridae (5 genera, 13 species)
Berendtimiridae (2 genera, 2 species)
Mysteriomorphidae (1 genus, 1 species)
Cretophengodidae (1 genus, 1 species)
Sinopyrophoridae (1 genus, 1 species)
